# My Git Story
Did you ever hear the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a sith legend.
Indeed. I've never heard this story before.
Not surprising at all if it's a sith legend.
But if it's from Darth Plagueis the Wise, I'm eager to hear more.
